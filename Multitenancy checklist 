My checklist for multitenancy

1. All models are scoped
a. Rails db
b. \dt 
c. Copy, loop through it, except some, adding the clinic id. 
d. Add default scope on chosen models
a. gp && gph && heroku run rake db:migrate
e. all the scoped models must belong to shema clinic


my_tables = %w{clinic_meds departments fees insurance_invoice_entries inventories invoice_items invoice_payments invoices lab_orders med_orders products services sub_test_orders sub_tests test_types user_types visit_tickets tests users patient_profiles}

irb(main):027:0> my_tables.map{|t| t.classify.constantize.update(clinic_id: 1)}


c. ensure that the subdomain is unique: on the db level, on the model level

d. ensure that the email is unique

e. For the clinic, please insert an automated user creator which also sends an email to the clinic owner, immersing them in the onboadring process. 

f. For every user created, send them an email content providing their temporary password, urging them to change it immediately.

g. Create demo clinic and its users
Clinic.create(name: "Demo Clinic", subdomain: "demo")
h. create demo users 
user_roles = ["Receptionist", "Doctor", "LabTechnician", "Pharmacist", "Admin"]

i. For online shema clinic, update the users in the db, add a role id. Type column should be removed

emails = ["reception@demo.com", "cons@demo.com", "lab@demo.com", "meds@demo.com", "admin@demo.com"]
clinic = Clinic.find_by_subdomain("demo")
user_types.zip(emails).each do |type, email|
	User.create!(first_name: "Demo User", email: "#{email}", password: "1234567",  password_confirmation: "1234567", type: "#{type}", clinic_id: clinic.id)
end

user_types.zip(emails).each do |type, email|
	puts "Department: #{type}" "|| Email: #{email} || Password: 1234567"
end



VERY IMPORTANT: The initial user experience

Maybe a user manual, which is searchable per topic, depending on the user type. 


3. Build a demo clinic with all different users,
Add a user scope to mention if they're valid (in the controller)


4. Build user onboarding
a. User manual
b. Tips and tooltips on hover of info icon


5. Build a patient portal

6. Build a backup background process

7. Build a hospitalization process

8. All should be TDD.
